<h1>Postmodernism's Response</h1>

<h2>Limits of Human Perception</h2>

<p>Einstein writes that there must exist a single objective reality, but that our perception of it is fallible and incomprehensive. As a consequence, he argues, what we believe to be "physically real" is not guaranteed to be accurate or complete.</p>

<p>This idea gained support in the postmodern era. Ward writes that postmodernism is less concerned with explaining phenomena, and more concerned with explaining <i>how</i> we explain these phenomena. Instead of developing strategies for creating accurate knowledge knowledge, intellectuals began questioning the entire idea of accurate knowledge production. Ward argues that postmodernists seek to emphasize the "forever tentative and political nature of all that is said and written."</p>
