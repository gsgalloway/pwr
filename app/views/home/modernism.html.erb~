<h1>The Modern Epistemology</h1>

<p> In his publication, <i>Reconfiguring Truth</i>, Steven C. Ward writes that the modern society reached an agreement with itself about how facts came into being. Truth could only be achieved via the scientific method. Knowledge produced in any other way was not, in fact, knowledge, but rather belief. </p>

<p> There were two major "other ways" of attempting to gain knowledge: through personal experience and through religion. The "lay knowledge" of everyday life was thought to rely on rumor from unscrupulous sources. It was also thought that the average person could not separate their bias from their own experience, and that personal experience could never be validated by anyone else, precisely because it is personal.  </p>
