<h1>Quantum Mechanics and Postmodernism</h1>

<h2>The Role of the Individual</h2>

<p>So we cannot achieve a complete understanding of our universe because the universe is not deterministic. But perhaps the next most notable aspect of quantum mechanics is the role of the "observer."</p>

<h3>Wave-Particle Duality</h3>

<p>The notion of "wave-particle duality" is the idea that all particles behave as both a wave and a particle simultaneously. This was demonstrated by the famous "double slit experiment" shown below.</p>

<p>This is similar to the previous examples of superimposed states of being, except the system "collapses" to a single reality once someone observes the system. That is, by observing a particle, a person forces it to exist in a certain state. Here this idea is explained by theoretical physicists Fred Alan Wolf and Amit Goswami</p>

<p>This then suggests that the individual is somehow <i>influencing</i> reality. By observing an event at that precise moment, the observer has caused a certain reality to exist, different perhaps from the one that would have existed had they observed the system a second later, or never at all.</p>

<p>This is an idea very much in line with postmodern thought. The individual self determines reality. "Reality" for one person may not necessarily be the same reality for another. In the modern era, the scientist was the authority on reality, because the scientist was the one to discover and apply the laws of the universe to give us understanding of the truth. But with quantum mechanics and all its modernity, the individual is the authority on reality because there simply <i>is</i> no reality until the individual makes it so.</p>

<p>So then if individual people can influence reality, it must follow that we can influence reality in alignment with our will. That is, we can craft reality into something of our liking. To many, this sounds like hocus-pocus, but for many reputed quantum physicists, this may certainly be the case. Observe again Dr. Amit Goswami, a professor of physics at the University of Oregon:</p>

<p>Then of course, if the individual is the new authority on reality, not the scientist, it follows that truth is no longer bestowed upon society by the scholars. Instead, truth is collectively constructed by each individual. The sum of every person's own perception of a thing becomes the reality of that thing &mdash; it is simultaneously every possibility for every individual.</p>
